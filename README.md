# Online-Test-App-Documentation

## Introduction


The Online Test Application system creates an application that
enables users to provide online tests, review them, and display the
results.

## System Details


This system contains three main modules: Quiz, Review, and
Result. The quiz section of the online test application accepts the
questions in JSON format. The JSON file can be easily shared
from the server in the pre-defined format. The application renders
the test at the client-side.



The “Review and display result” section allows users to declare the
results immediately. You can simply call another JSON with the
answers in it and evaluate and display the results immediately.
